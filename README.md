# threejs-learning-2025

Repo that contains monthly lessons/studies on Three.js, a WebGL framework.

## Personal Message

Last year, I was invited last minute to teach a computer graphics course at my old university, ISEP.

Unfortunately, due to personal and professional concerns, I was unable to do it. Mostly because I have forgotten almost everything I learned about computer graphics.

The school did tell me they would contact me again this year should they need to, so in this repo I'll add things I work on every month to re-learn computer graphics as well as Three.js since it's the tech the school utilizes. It would be cool to get contacted again to teach the course, but if I don't it's okay too. Learning is fun.

Computer Graphics have always been my favorite subject. I think it's really cool to just be able to render stuff with a computer. Even moreso when it's in 3D! When I was a kid I even wanted to be a CGI Artist. Sadly, burnouts take a toll on you by forcing you to just rest in your free time instead of doing your hobbies. Hopefully this year things will be a bit different and I will reach the end of 2025 with this repo full of cool examples of computer graphics in Three.js =)

My goal is to at least study 30 minutes per week.

Best,
_Gil_
