# January Learnings

## January 19th

Today I followed the [Creating a scene](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) tutorial to recall how to create a scene with a camera, creating meshes out of geometries and materials, and adding said meshes to the scene and render them.

I also read about the concept of [viewing frustum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum)
